# houseParty

## Inspiration
  We were inspired by classic radios that allow you to call in to request a particular song. We want to bring that idea into the 21st century through streaming services.

## What it does
  The final product allows you to add a song to a public queue specific to your local party and allows the party-goers to up-vote or down-vote all the upcoming songs in the queue.

## How we built it
  We built the front-end using react-native to allow us to quickly prototype on multiple mobile platforms. Express and Node were used to get a simple backend server running quickly, while also facilitating asynchronous calls. The Octave API was used to stream music.
